# 📈 Historical Tracking Page - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Zero Data Counts
**Problem**: All measures showing 0.0% current rates and zero counts

**Root Cause**: 
- Query was only looking for data in a narrow 90-day window
- If no data found in that range, it returned zeros
- No fallback to wider date ranges

**Solution**:
- Added progressive date range fallback (90 days → 180 days → 365 days)
- Better handling of empty dataframes
- Improved NaN value handling in success rate calculations
- Uses most recent available data even if older

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/historical_tracking.py` - `calculate_status()` method

### 2. ✅ Legend Overlapping Chart Title
**Problem**: Legend was printing over the "Monthly Success Rate Trends" chart title

**Root Cause**:
- Legend positioned at `y=1.02` (just above chart)
- Title at default position overlapped with legend

**Solution**:
- Moved legend below chart (`y=-0.25`)
- Added proper margins (`t=100, b=50, l=50, r=50`)
- Centered chart title
- Changed legend to horizontal orientation at bottom

**Files Changed**:
- `pages/10_📈_Historical_Tracking.py` - Chart layout configuration

### 3. ✅ Status Badge HTML Not Rendering
**Problem**: Status badges showing raw HTML like `<span class="status-badge...">` instead of rendered badges

**Root Cause**:
- HTML strings inserted into pandas DataFrame
- Streamlit displays DataFrame HTML as text, not rendered HTML

**Solution**:
- Replaced DataFrame display with column-based rendering
- Used `st.markdown()` with `unsafe_allow_html=True` for each row
- Added proper table header row
- Each status badge now renders as colored badge with trend indicator

**Files Changed**:
- `pages/10_📈_Historical_Tracking.py` - Status table rendering

## Improvements Made

### Data Query Improvements
- **Progressive fallback**: Tries multiple date ranges if no data found
- **NaN handling**: Properly handles missing/null values in calculations
- **Recent data priority**: Uses most recent data available, even if outside ideal window

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Better table display**: Properly rendered status badges with colors
- **Chart layout**: No more overlapping legend
- **Clearer formatting**: Better column alignment and spacing

## Testing

### How to Verify Fixes:

1. **Check Data Display**:
   - Navigate to Historical Tracking page
   - Status Overview should show actual rates (not all 0.0%)
   - If no data exists, should show "Unknown" status properly

2. **Check Chart Layout**:
   - Scroll to "Monthly Trends" section
   - Verify legend is below chart (not overlapping title)
   - Title should be clearly visible at top

3. **Check Status Badges**:
   - Status column should show colored badges (not raw HTML)
   - Badges should have proper colors:
     - Green for "On Track"
     - Yellow for "At Risk"  
     - Red for "Critical"
   - Trend indicators (📈📉➡️) should display next to badges

### Expected Behavior:

- **With Data**: Shows actual success rates, proper status badges, working charts
- **Without Data**: Shows "Unknown" status, 0.0% rates, but no errors
- **Partial Data**: Uses whatever data is available, expands date range as needed

## Notes

The page should now:
- ✅ Display actual data from database (if available)
- ✅ Show properly formatted status badges
- ✅ Display charts with legends that don't overlap titles
- ✅ Handle missing data gracefully
- ✅ Use progressive date range search for better data discovery

If data still shows as zero, it likely means:
- No intervention data exists in the database for those measures
- Date ranges don't match actual data dates
- Database connection issues (check other pages)

The fixes ensure the page works correctly when data exists, and handles gracefully when it doesn't!
