# 🔧 Fix: AI API Not Configured Error

## Problem Identified
The error "AI API Not Configured" appears because:
1. ✅ **API Key is configured** - Your Anthropic API key is correctly set in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
2. ❌ **Package is missing** - The `anthropic` Python package is not installed
3. ⚠️ **Code can't detect key** - Without the package, the code can't use the API key

## Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install the Anthropic Package

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt and run:

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

**OR** install all dependencies:

```bash
cd Artifacts\project\phase4_dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**OR** run the installation script:

```bash
cd Artifacts\project\phase4_dashboard
.\INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.bat
```

**OR** use the Python script I created:

```bash
cd Artifacts\project\phase4_dashboard
python install_anthropic.py
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that it installed:

```bash
python -c "import anthropic; print('✅ Anthropic installed:', anthropic.__version__)"
```

### Step 3: Restart Streamlit

**IMPORTANT:** You must restart Streamlit for it to detect the new package!

1. Stop the current Streamlit process (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Restart it:
   ```bash
   cd Artifacts\project\phase4_dashboard
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Improved error messages - Now shows which packages are missing
2. ✅ Better diagnostics - The page now tells you exactly what to install
3. ✅ Installation guide created - `INSTALL_ANTHROPIC.md` and `install_anthropic.py`

## After Installing

Navigate to the **🤖 AI Executive Insights** page and you should see:
- ✅ **"✅ Using ANTHROPIC API"** in the sidebar
- ✅ **"✨ Generate AI Insights"** button available

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Anthropic package installed (`pip install anthropic`)
- [ ] API key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (already done ✅)
- [ ] Streamlit restarted after installing package
- [ ] Page shows "✅ Using ANTHROPIC API"

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check the improved error message on the AI Executive Insights page - it now shows exactly what's missing
2. Verify installation: `python -c "import anthropic"`
3. Check secrets file exists: `Artifacts\project\phase4_dashboard\.streamlit\secrets.toml`
4. Make sure you fully restarted Streamlit (not just refreshed the browser)
