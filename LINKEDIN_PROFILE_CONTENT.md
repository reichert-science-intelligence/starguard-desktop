## ABOUT SECTION

The Real AI Bottleneck in Healthcare Isn't Technology—It's Trust and Compliance

Healthcare organizations know AI is transformative. But they can't deploy it because traditional solutions require exposing protected health information to external APIs—violating HIPAA and breaking patient trust.

I solve that problem.

I'm a Healthcare Data Scientist and AI Engineer specializing in secure, on-premises AI implementations that deliver LLM-powered insights WITHOUT external data transmission. With $148M+ in documented impact across my career, I bridge the gap between enterprise AI adoption and regulatory compliance.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT MAKES MY APPROACH DIFFERENT

🔒 Security-First Architecture

I design AI systems that keep PHI on-premises—local LLMs, on-premises vector search, zero external API calls. This isn't theoretical: my HEDIS Portfolio Optimizer demonstrates production-ready HIPAA compliance.

📊 Hard Metrics Over Hype

Every project ties to measurable outcomes: time saved, costs reduced, revenue protected. My predictive models achieve 93%+ recall with documented ROI projections of 2.8-4.1x annual return.

🏗️ Production-Ready Code

I don't build demos—I build systems that scale. My flagship project includes 10,400+ lines of enterprise-grade PostgreSQL, comprehensive error handling, and audit trails that satisfy compliance officers.

🎯 Business Value Quantification

I translate AI capabilities into language CFOs understand: $380K annual value projections, preventable hospitalization reduction, Star Rating revenue protection.

FEATURED PROJECT: HEDIS PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZER

A production-grade analytics platform demonstrating:

- 93% predictive accuracy on high-risk member identification
- 2.8-4.1x ROI projection with documented assumptions
- 10,000+ member records (enterprise complexity)
- HIPAA-compliant architecture blueprint for scaling to production PHI

This isn't just a portfolio piece—it's a reference implementation showing how healthcare organizations can adopt AI while maintaining compliance and patient trust.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

I'm currently interviewing for senior roles where I can help healthcare organizations solve their AI adoption challenges—positions like Chief Innovation Officer, CTO, Director of AI/Analytics, or Senior Healthcare Data Scientist.

If your organization is facing:

❌ Legal concerns blocking AI projects due to PHI exposure
❌ Finance demanding ROI proof before approving investments
❌ Security requiring on-premises deployment for sensitive data
❌ Operations skeptical of fragile demos that won't scale

Let's talk. I specialize in the last mile of AI adoption—building systems that satisfy compliance officers, CFOs, security teams, and technical staff.
