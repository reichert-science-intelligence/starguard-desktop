### Full "About" Section Template

```markdown
I solve the healthcare industry's biggest AI dilemma: how to leverage LLM capabilities without exposing protected health information. By architecting on-premises AI solutions and secure data pipelines, I enable healthcare organizations to adopt transformative AI while maintaining HIPAA compliance and patient trust.

With expertise in local LLM deployment, on-premises vector search, and secure data architectures, I bridge the gap between AI innovation and healthcare compliance. My work demonstrates that healthcare organizations don't have to choose between cutting-edge AI capabilities and patient data security.

**Key Achievements:**
• Architected HIPAA-compliant HEDIS Portfolio Optimizer: 2.8-4.1x ROI, zero external API exposure
• Deployed secure predictive models: 93% recall, $380K annual value, local LLM processing
• Engineered enterprise-scale data infrastructure: 10,400+ lines, AI-ready architecture

**Technical Expertise:**
• Secure AI Deployment: Local LLMs (Ollama), on-premises vector search (ChromaDB)
• Healthcare Analytics: HEDIS measures, Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, PHI-protected analytics
• Data Engineering: PostgreSQL, Python, Streamlit, secure data pipelines

**The Problem I Solve:**
Healthcare organizations want to leverage AI/LLM capabilities but face a critical barrier: they cannot expose protected health information (PHI) to external APIs. Traditional cloud AI solutions require Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) and create compliance risks. My approach eliminates these barriers by deploying AI entirely on-premises, enabling healthcare innovation without compromising patient trust.

### Sample Posts

**Post 1: The Healthcare AI Dilemma**
```markdown
Healthcare organizations face a critical dilemma: they want to leverage LLM capabilities but cannot expose PHI to external APIs.

I've been solving this by architecting on-premises AI solutions:
✅ Local LLM deployment (Ollama)
✅ On-premises vector search (ChromaDB)
✅ Zero external API exposure
✅ Full HIPAA compliance

Result: 2.8-4.1x ROI while maintaining patient trust.

What's your approach to secure AI in healthcare?

**Post 2: The $50B Barrier**
```markdown
The healthcare AI market is projected to reach $50B+, but adoption is slowed by one critical barrier: PHI exposure concerns.

Traditional cloud AI requires:
❌ Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
❌ External API data transmission
❌ Vendor dependency
❌ Compliance risks

My secure approach eliminates these:
✅ On-premises processing
✅ Local model deployment
✅ Zero external exposure
✅ Internal approval only

This is how we bridge the gap between AI innovation and healthcare compliance.
