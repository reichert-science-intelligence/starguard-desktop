5. **Weekly Review**: Analyze alert patterns and adjust thresholds

## ⚙️ Configuration Tips

### Star Rating Threshold
- **85%**: Standard threshold for most measures
- **90%**: Stricter threshold for high-priority measures
- **80%**: More lenient for challenging measures

### Opportunity Value Threshold
- **$10,000**: Good starting point
- **$25,000**: Focus on larger opportunities
- **$5,000**: Catch smaller opportunities

### Deadline Days Ahead
- **30 days**: Standard planning window
- **14 days**: More urgent focus
- **60 days**: Longer planning horizon

### Anomaly Threshold
- **15%**: Standard sensitivity
- **10%**: More sensitive to changes
- **20%**: Less sensitive, fewer false positives

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Review Daily**: Check alerts at start of each day
2. **Configure Wisely**: Set thresholds based on your targets
3. **Prioritize Critical**: Address critical alerts immediately
4. **Batch Process**: Group similar alerts for efficiency
5. **Track Actions**: Use alerts to guide response plans
6. **Adjust Over Time**: Fine-tune thresholds based on alert volume

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"No alerts generated"**
- Check date range includes data
- Verify alert types are enabled
- Ensure thresholds aren't too strict
