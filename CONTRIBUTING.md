## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow **PEP 8** with the following specific requirements:

#### Code Formatting

- **Line length:** Maximum 100 characters (88 for Black compatibility)
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes:** Double quotes for strings (Black default)
- **Imports:** Sorted and grouped (isort)

```python
# ✅ GOOD
from typing import List, Optional
import pandas as pd
from utils.database import execute_query

# ❌ BAD
import pandas as pd
from utils.database import execute_query
from typing import List, Optional
```

#### Type Hints

**All functions must include type hints:**

```python
# ✅ GOOD
def calculate_roi(
    intervention_cost: float,
    quality_bonus: float,
    member_count: int
) -> float:
    """Calculate ROI ratio for interventions."""
    return (quality_bonus * member_count) / intervention_cost

# ❌ BAD
def calculate_roi(intervention_cost, quality_bonus, member_count):
    return (quality_bonus * member_count) / intervention_cost
```

#### Docstrings

**All functions, classes, and modules must have docstrings:**

```python
def get_available_members(
    measure_id: Optional[str] = None,
    status_filter: List[str] = None,
    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    end_date: Optional[str] = None
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Get list of members available for campaign selection.
    
    Args:
        measure_id: Filter by specific HEDIS measure ID
        status_filter: List of intervention statuses to include
        start_date: Filter by intervention date start (YYYY-MM-DD)
        end_date: Filter by intervention date end (YYYY-MM-DD)
    
    Returns:
        DataFrame with member information including:
        - member_id
        - measure_id
        - intervention_date
        - status
        - cost_per_intervention
    
    Raises:
        DatabaseError: If query execution fails
        ValueError: If date format is invalid
    
    Example:
        >>> members = get_available_members(
        ...     measure_id="CDC",
        ...     status_filter=["pending", "scheduled"],
        ...     start_date="2024-01-01",
        ...     end_date="2024-12-31"
        ... )
        >>> len(members)
        150
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Code Quality Tools

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .

# Type checking

## 🔒 Security Requirements

### Critical Security Rules

**These rules are non-negotiable and will result in immediate rejection of contributions if violated:**

#### 1. No PHI in Commits

**NEVER commit:**
- ❌ Protected Health Information (PHI)
- ❌ Real patient data
- ❌ Member IDs from production systems
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII)

**ALWAYS use:**
- ✅ De-identified sample data
- ✅ Synthetic test data
- ✅ Anonymized identifiers (e.g., "MEMBER_001")
- ✅ Data generators for testing

```python
# ✅ GOOD - De-identified data
member_id = "DEMO_MEMBER_001"
member_name = "Test Member"

# ❌ BAD - Real PHI
member_id = "123456789"  # Real member ID
member_name = "John Doe"  # Real name
```

#### 2. Secrets Management

**NEVER commit:**
- ❌ Database passwords
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Connection strings with credentials
- ❌ Environment variables with secrets

**ALWAYS use:**
- ✅ `.env` file (in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Secret management services (for production)
- ✅ `.env.example` for documentation

```python
# ✅ GOOD
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")

# ❌ BAD
db_password = "my_secret_password"  # Hardcoded secret
```

#### 3. SQL Injection Prevention

**ALWAYS use parameterized queries:**

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM members WHERE measure_id = %s"
execute_query(query, (measure_id,))

# ❌ BAD - String formatting (SQL injection risk)
query = f"SELECT * FROM members WHERE measure_id = '{measure_id}'"
execute_query(query)
```

#### 4. External API Restrictions

**This project maintains zero external API exposure:**

- ❌ No calls to external APIs with PHI
- ❌ No cloud-based AI services
- ✅ All AI processing must be on-premises
- ✅ Use local LLMs (Ollama) only

### Security Checklist

Before submitting a PR, verify:

- [ ] No PHI or PII in code or commits
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All database queries use parameterization
- [ ] No external API calls with sensitive data
- [ ] Environment variables used for configuration
- [ ] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Security-sensitive code reviewed

└── fixtures/              # Test data and fixtures
    ├── sample_data.json
    └── ...
```

### Writing Tests

**All new features must include tests:**

```python
# tests/unit/test_roi_calculator.py
import pytest
from utils.roi_calculator import calculate_roi_ratio

def test_calculate_roi_ratio_positive():
    """Test ROI calculation with positive return."""
    intervention_cost = 10000.0
    quality_bonus = 50000.0
    member_count = 1000
    
    roi = calculate_roi_ratio(
        intervention_cost=intervention_cost,
        quality_bonus=quality_bonus,
        member_count=member_count
    )
    
    assert roi == pytest.approx(5.0, rel=0.01)
    assert roi > 1.0  # Positive ROI

def test_calculate_roi_ratio_zero_cost():
    """Test ROI calculation with zero cost (edge case)."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Intervention cost must be positive"):
        calculate_roi_ratio(
            intervention_cost=0.0,
            quality_bonus=50000.0,
            member_count=1000
        )
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests:** Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration tests:** For database operations and data pipelines
- **Edge cases:** Test error conditions and boundary values
- **Data validation:** Test with de-identified sample data only

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_roi_calculator.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Data Validation Tests

**Always validate data before processing:**

```python
def test_validate_member_data():
    """Test member data validation."""
    # Valid data
    valid_data = {
        "member_id": "DEMO_001",
        "measure_id": "CDC",
        "intervention_date": "2024-01-15",
        "status": "completed"
    }
    assert validate_member_data(valid_data) is True
    
    # Invalid data - missing required field
    invalid_data = {
        "member_id": "DEMO_001",
        # Missing measure_id
    }
    assert validate_member_data(invalid_data) is False
```

## 🏥 Healthcare Compliance Notes

### HIPAA Considerations for Contributors

This project demonstrates architecture for healthcare data processing. Contributors must understand:

#### Protected Health Information (PHI)

**PHI includes:**
- Names, addresses, phone numbers
- Medical record numbers
- Health plan beneficiary numbers
- Dates (birth, admission, discharge, death)
- Any unique identifier that could identify an individual

**In this project:**
- ✅ We use **de-identified data only**
- ✅ Sample data uses synthetic identifiers
- ✅ No real member information is processed
- ✅ All test data is anonymized

#### Compliance Requirements

**For production deployment:**
- Full HIPAA compliance audit required
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) if using vendors
- Access controls and audit logging
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Incident response procedures

**For development:**
- Use only de-identified sample data
- Never commit PHI to version control
- Follow security best practices
- Understand data privacy implications

#### Data Handling Best Practices

1. **Minimize data collection:** Only collect necessary data
2. **De-identify early:** Remove PHI as soon as possible
3. **Access controls:** Limit who can access sensitive data
4. **Audit trails:** Log all data access
5. **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit

### Compliance Checklist for Contributors

Before contributing code that handles data:

- [ ] Understand what constitutes PHI
- [ ] Verify no PHI in test data or code
- [ ] Use de-identified data only
- [ ] Follow data minimization principles
- [ ] Implement appropriate access controls
- [ ] Add audit logging where needed
- [ ] Document compliance considerations
