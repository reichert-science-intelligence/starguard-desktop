# Compliance Architecture: Production PHI Data Scaling
## One-Pager Summary

---

## 🎯 Core Principle: Zero PHI Exposure to External APIs

**All AI/ML processing occurs on-premises using local models. No healthcare data ever leaves your secure network.**

---

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

```
User Question → Local Embedding (Ollama) → Vector Search (ChromaDB) 
→ SQL Generation (Local LLM) → Database Query (Internal) → Response (De-identified)
```

**Key Point:** Every step happens on-premises. Zero external API calls.

## 🔐 Security Controls

### Encryption at Rest
- ✅ Database: AES-256 encryption
- ✅ Vector Store: ChromaDB with field-level encryption
- ✅ File System: OS-level encryption (BitLocker/FileVault)
- ✅ Backups: Encrypted before storage

### Encryption in Transit
- ✅ TLS 1.3 for all communications
- ✅ Encrypted database connections
- ✅ mTLS for internal APIs
- ✅ Zero external network calls

### Access Logging
- ✅ User authentication logged (user ID, timestamp, IP)
- ✅ All queries logged (PHI redacted in logs)
- ✅ Model inference tracking (local models only)
- ✅ Vector search logging
- ✅ Immutable audit trail (7-year retention)

### Access Controls
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required
- ✅ Session timeout (15 minutes inactivity)
- ✅ IP whitelisting

### Data Minimization
- ✅ Automatic PHI de-identification before display
- ✅ Default to aggregate statistics
- ✅ Field masking (SSN, MRN, DOB)
- ✅ k-anonymity enforcement

## 📋 Comparison: Cloud AI vs Secure Approach

| Aspect | Traditional Cloud AI | Secure On-Premises |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **PHI Transmission** | Data sent to external APIs | Zero external transmission |
| **Compliance Risk** | High | Low |
| **Data Control** | Limited (vendor) | Full control |
| **Cost Model** | Per-API-call | Fixed infrastructure |
| **Offline Capability** | Requires internet | Works offline |
| **Regulatory Approval** | BAA required | Internal only |

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Infrastructure Requirements
1. **On-Premises Servers**
   - Application server (Streamlit)
   - Database server (encrypted)
   - Vector store server (ChromaDB)
   - LLM inference server (Ollama or Azure Private Endpoint)

2. **Network Security**
   - Firewall rules (no external access)
   - VPN for remote access
   - Network segmentation (DMZ for web, isolated for data)

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Automated breach alerts

### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load-balanced application servers
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas for performance
- **Vector Store Scaling**: Distributed ChromaDB cluster
- **LLM Scaling**: Multiple inference servers with load balancing

---

## ✅ Compliance Certifications

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Full compliance with all required controls
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual security audits
- **HITRUST**: Healthcare-specific security framework
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

---

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Zero External Data Exposure**: PHI never leaves your network
2. **Complete Data Control**: You own and control all data processing
3. **Simplified Compliance**: No external vendor BAAs required
4. **Predictable Costs**: Fixed infrastructure vs variable API costs
5. **Offline Capability**: Works in air-gapped environments
6. **Full Customization**: Adapt to your specific needs
