# HEI Page Enhancements & Testing Plan

## Enhancements Completed

### 1. Database Integration ✅
- Created `utils/hei_queries.py` with database query utilities
- Added graceful fallback to synthetic data if database unavailable
- Database queries support both PostgreSQL and SQLite

### 2. Error Handling ✅  
- Added try/except blocks around database operations
- Graceful degradation when data unavailable
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Code Quality ✅
- All imports properly organized
- Functions well-documented
- Consistent code style

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test page loads without errors
- [ ] Test database connection (if available)
- [ ] Test fallback to synthetic data
- [ ] Test all visualizations render correctly
- [ ] Test all sliders and filters work
- [ ] Test CSV exports function
- [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

## Known Issues to Fix

1. **Missing total_revenue variable** - Needs to come from plan context
2. **Database schema assumptions** - Queries assume certain table/column names
3. **Synthetic data only** - Currently uses generated data

## Next Steps

1. Test the page in Streamlit
2. Fix any runtime errors
3. Enhance database queries based on actual schema
4. Add more features from the plan
