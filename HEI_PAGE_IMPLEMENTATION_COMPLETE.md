- ✅ **Scenario Modeling Sliders**:
  - Target Disparity Reduction (0-50%)
  - Intervention Budget ($0-$5M)
  - Timeline (3-24 months)
  - Reward Factor (0-10%)

### 5. Data & Calculations
- ✅ **HEI Score Calculation** - Weighted average across measures
- ✅ **Disparity Gap Calculation** - Max - Min rates by demographic
- ✅ **Equity Score Calculation** - Normalized 0-100 scale
- ✅ **Measure-Level Metrics** - Comprehensive equity analysis

- `calculate_measure_equity_metrics()` - Comprehensive per-measure analysis

### Configuration
- Loads from `config_prod.yaml`:
  - `analytics.hei.disparity_threshold: 4.0`
  - `analytics.hei.reward_factor_projection: 0.05`
- Graceful fallback to defaults if config unavailable
