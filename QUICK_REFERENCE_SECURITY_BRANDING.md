## 🎨 Canva Visuals Needed

### 1. Security Architecture Visual
- **Title**: "Bridging the Healthcare AI Gap"
- **Left**: Traditional Cloud AI (❌ external APIs, HIPAA concerns)
- **Right**: My Secure Approach (✅ local LLM, on-premises, zero PHI exposure)
- **Bottom**: "Enabling $billions in healthcare AI adoption while maintaining patient trust"

### 2. Project Impact Dashboard
- **3 Projects**: HEDIS Optimizer, Glycemic Model, Secure Chatbot
- **For Each**: Security, Impact, Tech stack

---

## 💬 Influencer Engagement Template

**When commenting on AI adoption posts:**

> "This resonates with my work solving the healthcare AI paradox: organizations want LLM capabilities but can't expose PHI to external APIs. I've been building HIPAA-compliant alternatives using local deployment + on-premises vector search. [Link to your project]. Would love your perspective on this approach."

**Target Influencers:**
