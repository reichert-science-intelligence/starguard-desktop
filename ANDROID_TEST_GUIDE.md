## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Can't Connect from Phone

**Problem:** Phone can't reach `http://192.168.1.161:8502`

**Solutions:**
1. **Check WiFi:** Both devices on same network?
2. **Check Firewall:** Windows Firewall may be blocking port 8502
   - Go to Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
   - Allow Streamlit through firewall
3. **Check Streamlit:** Make sure it's running with `--server.address 0.0.0.0`

4. **Check console:** Open Chrome DevTools on phone (if possible)
